# Frontend Mentor - QR code component

## The challenge

The challenge was to build out a QR code component provided by Front-end mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I did my best using only vanilla html and css and I'm proud of the result I got. Now I'm moving on to a next challenge of the site and I'll be posting it here soon.
